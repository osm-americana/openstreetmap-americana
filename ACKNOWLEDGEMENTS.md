- The stylized highway shields are inspired by "[Rebusurance](https://github.com/1ec5/rebusurance/)" by Minh Nguyễn.
- Initial layer code is derived from Oliver Wipfli's [openmaptiles-starter](https://github.com/wipfli/openmaptiles-starter/) style.
- The font stack was [packaged by the OpenHistoricalMap project](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/map-styles/).
- Support for right-to-left Arabic and Hebrew text is provided by the [mapbox-gl-rtl-text](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-rtl-text/) plugin.
